model_info stores best network.

please note that training plateaued ~64th best net in the first run, 69th net consistently lost by a small amount to the 64th net.

learning rate for 64th net was manually lowered from 0.001 to 0.0003 (using https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47523841/using-keras-to-load-model-and-assign-new-values-to-its-parameters)

all nets from 65 onward were deleted and training restarted.

74 and 78 were compared



93rd network could barely beat the 74th network. Probably needs a lowering of learning rate again.

93rd model renamed to 0th model in order to save space while putting to gdrive.

Learning rate was manually lowered once again to 0.0001.

20th model, new best, was lowered to 1e-5 learning rate. Then it was renamed to the 0th model yet again.

Then the 21st model after that was renamed to 0th again.


Next step: build a deeper model
